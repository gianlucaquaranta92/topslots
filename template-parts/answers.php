            3.We have a website that needs to block traffic from a country only for desktop users during working hours. How would you tackle this?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
            I would personally use Cloudflare's firewall to block traffic from the specified country based on the 'country' field. Then, Iâ€™d set a rule to check for desktop user agents and apply the rule only during working hours by using the time-based conditions.

            4.If we were to start a new affiliate project, how would you set up the perfect environment, including WordPress etc?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
            For a successful affiliate project, the key focus is performance, SEO, and conversions.
            <br>First of all, I would start by choosing a high-speed hosting provider, preferably with built-in caching and CDN support. I would pick an SEO plugin to help optimize content, and to keep the theme lightweight, I would use a task runner like gulp or webpack for automatic minification during development.
            <br><br>
            Depending on the project's scale, I would choose the best redirection method, keeping it simple for smaller sites and using a more scalable solution if extensive tracking is needed.
            <br> Additionally, integrating analytics tools would be essential for performance measurement and conversions.
